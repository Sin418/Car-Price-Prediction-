# Car Price Prediction

This project demonstrates how to predict car prices using TensorFlow.

## Dependencies

- pandas
- seaborn
- tensorflow
- matplotlib

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about car attributes such as years, kilometers driven, rating, condition, economy, top speed, horsepower, torque, and current price.

## Code Structure

- `car_price_prediction.py`: Main script containing the code for training and evaluating the model.
- `train.csv`: Dataset file containing car attributes.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Download the dataset (`train.csv`) and place it in the project directory.
3. Run the script `car_price_prediction.py`.
4. The trained model will be saved in the current directory.

## Results

The model achieves a root mean squared error of X on the test dataset. See `model_performance.png` for a plot of the model's performance during training.
